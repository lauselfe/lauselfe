### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Laura's here! :cherry_blossom:
ðŸ“š I'm a postgraduate degree student from Spain. I'm currently working on my Final Postdegree Project: an interactive math student web book. It's a WIP but you can take a look here: http://lauselfe.me/webmats

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and finishing the Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification from freecodecamp.org (and enjoying it a lot so far!)
